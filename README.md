# PyBer: Ride-Sharing by City Type
## An analysis of impact on fares based on types of cities:

### Overview of the Analysis:
#### PyBer is a ride-sharing app that is valued at $2.3 Billion. As commisioned by the CEO, V. Isualize, this analysis serves to dive into ride share data that was collected between January 2019 through May 2019. Through various data points, such as, driver counts, city types, fare prices, and dates of service we have determined areas of best practice that can be recommended to PyBer for more efficient business decisions. The ulimate goal for this analysis is to help improve access to ride-share services and appropriately address any disparities in ride-share accessibility/affordability for underserved areas. 

### Results:

#### In order to compare fares and acessibility to ride-share services, I grouped data into different sections based on three city types: urban, suburban, and rural. When comparing costs of fares between these three city types, rural cities in general paid almost $10 more per ride compared to those from urban cities. Suburban consumers paid almost $6 more per ride as compared to urban users.


#### It should be noted that the number of rides completed in rural areas was almost 10 times lower than those serviced in urban cities. 

#### Conversely, the average fare per driver had an inverse relationship. The average urban city driver made around $16.50 per ride, while rural drivers earned around $55 per ride. Quite a large difference!

#### Based on the line graph produced above, indicating "Total Fares by City Types" we can see the trends in total fares based on the three city types. Here, we can see that Urban fares (yellow line) increased from $1,600 to $2,300 over the year. For Suburban cities, fares increased from $700 to around $1400 over the four month period. Finally, for rural cities, rates stayed around $300 over the time period. 

### Summary and Recommendations: 
#### Based on this analysis the following inferences and recommendations can be made to PyBer:

#### - There is higher usage of PyBer services in urban areas, and therefore having the lower prices for users could be beneficial, since it will continue growth in usage. However, prices should be slightly increased to provide more revenue for the drivers, as they are earning significantly less money in these areas.

#### - For rural users, prices should be lowered. There is a chance that the significantly low numbers of usage could be due to the $10 price disparity per ride as compared to urban users. 

#### Finally, across all three city types, there was a peak in total fares paid at the end of February. This should be further analyzed for correlations to more rides during this period as related to events to potentially offer more drivers or lower fares during this time frame to engage with more users.
